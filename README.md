# hxjson

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hxjson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hxjson)

This library contains a JSON parser that parses JSON (sic!) into a position-aware typed
value objects. This is useful for writing all kinds of JSON validation and processing software.

It also contains a printer for those objects, supporting pretty-printing.

Originally, the parsing and printing code comes from standard `haxe.format.JsonParser/JsonPrinter` classes.

Generated API documentation: <https://nadako.github.io/hxjson/>

Requires Haxe 3.3rc1 or later.

**Status**: Just started, work in progress, soon to be done.
